# Pronouns
There are **three** types of pronouns.

1. **Personal** pronouns, which refer to specific people or objects. (e.g. I, you, he, she, it, they).
2. **Demonstrative** pronouns, which are used to specify something with a sense of location. (e.g. this, that, these those).
3. **Relative** pronouns, which are used to refer to nouns previously mentioned and to introduce relative clauses which describe or modify the noun (e.g. that, which, who).
